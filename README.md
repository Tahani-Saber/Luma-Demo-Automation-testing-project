### Content Automation Testing 

**Software Testing**:  
Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements and to ensure that software product is Defect free. It involves execution of software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest. The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, gaps or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements.  
  
Some prefer saying Software testing definition as a White Box and Black Box Testing. In simple terms, Software Testing means the Verification of Application 
Under Test (AUT)
  
**What is Automation Testing?**:  
Automation Testing is a software testing technique that performs using special automated testing software tools to execute a test case suite. On the contrary,Manual Testing is performed by a human sitting in front of a computer carefully executing the test steps.  
The automation testing software can also enter test data into the System Under Test, compare expected and actual results and generate detailed test reports.Software Test Automation demands considerable investments of money and resources.  
Successive development cycles will require execution of same test suite repeatedly. Using a test automation tool, itâ€™s possible to record this test suite and re-play it as required. Once the test suite is automated, no human intervention is required. This improved ROI of Test Automation. The goal of Automation is to reduce the number of test cases to be run manually and not to eliminate Manual Testing altogether.
