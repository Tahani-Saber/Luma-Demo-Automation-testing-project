### Content Automation Testing 

**Software Testing**:  
Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements and to ensure that software product is Defect free. It involves execution of software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest. The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, gaps or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements.  
  
Some prefer saying Software testing definition as a White Box and Black Box Testing. In simple terms, Software Testing means the Verification of Application 
Under Test (AUT)
  
**What is Automation Testing?**:  
Automation Testing is a software testing technique that performs using special automated testing software tools to execute a test case suite. On the contrary,Manual Testing is performed by a human sitting in front of a computer carefully executing the test steps.  
The automation testing software can also enter test data into the System Under Test, compare expected and actual results and generate detailed test reports.Software Test Automation demands considerable investments of money and resources.  
Successive development cycles will require execution of same test suite repeatedly. Using a test automation tool, itâ€™s possible to record this test suite and re-play it as required. Once the test suite is automated, no human intervention is required. This improved ROI of Test Automation. The goal of Automation is to reduce the number of test cases to be run manually and not to eliminate Manual Testing altogether.  

**Difference Between Manual And Automation Testing**  

| Automation Testing | Manual Testing |
| ---- | ---- |
| Automated testing is more reliable. It performs same operation each time. It eliminates the risk of human errors. | Manual testing is less reliable. Due to human error, manual testing is not accurate all the time. |
| Initial investment of automation testing is higher. Investment is required for testing tools. In the long run it is less expensive than manual. ROI is higher in the long run compared to Manual testing. | Initial investment of manual testing is less than automation. Investment is required for human resources. ROI is lower in the long run compared to Automation testing. |
| Automation testing is a practical option when we do regressions testing. | Manual testing is a practical option where the test cases are not run repeatedly and only needs to run once or twice. |
| Execution is done through software tools, so it is faster than manual testing and needs less human resources compared to manual testing. | Execution of test cases is time consuming and needs more human resources |
| Exploratory testing is not possible | Exploratory testing is possible |
| Performance Testing like Load Testing, Stress Testing etc. is a practical option in automation testing. | Performance Testing is not a practical option in manual testing |
| It can be done in parallel and reduce test execution time. | Its not an easy task to execute test cases in parallel in manual testing. We need more human resources to do this and becomes more expensive. |
| Programming knowledge is a must in automation testing | Programming knowledge is not required to do manual testing. |
| Build verification testing (BVT) is highly recommended | Build verification testing (BVT) is not recommended |
| Human intervention is not much, so it is not effective to do User Interface testing. | It involves human intervention, so it is highly effective to do User Interface testing. |  

**Which Test Cases To Automate?**:
Test Cases to automate are as follows
- Data-driven test cases
- Test cases with higher complexity
- Test case with many database updates
- The test execution rate is high
- Smoke/Critical tests
- Tests with several combinations
- Graph test cases
- Higher manual execution time

**Which Test Cases Not To Be Automated?**:
Types of tests need to be performed manually are as follows
- Subjective Validation
- New Functionalities
- Strategic Development
- User Experience
- Complex Functionality
- Quality Control
- Low return on investment
- Installation and setup testing
